# CV Formatting Fix Summary

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Bold Text Line Break Issue ✅
**Problem:** Bold text in paragraphs was appearing on a separate line instead of inline with surrounding text.

**Example of the issue:**
```
Postdoctoral researcher specializing in
water quality modeling
and
biogeochemical processes
in rivers and estuaries.
```

**Root Cause:** The CSS rule `p strong:first-child { display: block; }` was forcing bold elements that appear as the first child of a paragraph to be displayed as block-level elements, causing line breaks.

**Solution:** Removed the problematic CSS rule and replaced it with a simpler spacing rule that keeps bold text inline.

**Result:** Now correctly renders as:
```
Postdoctoral researcher specializing in water quality modeling and biogeochemical processes in rivers and estuaries.
```

### 2. Excessive Spacing Issue ✅
**Problem:** The CV had too much vertical spacing, making it unnecessarily long and requiring excessive scrolling.

**Changes Made:**
- Reduced body line-height from 1.6 to 1.5 (more compact text)
- Reduced h2 top margin from 1.5em to 1em (-33%)
- Reduced h2 bottom margin from 0.6em to 0.5em
- Reduced h3 top margin from 1em to 0.7em
- Reduced h3 bottom margin from 0.4em to 0.3em
- Reduced h4 top margin from 0.8em to 0.6em
- Reduced h4 bottom margin from 0.3em to 0.2em
- Reduced horizontal rules margin from 1.5em to 1em
- Reduced section margin-bottom from 1.2em to 0.8em
- Reduced paragraph bottom margin from 0.8em to 0.5em
- Reduced blockquote margins and padding
- Reduced list item spacing and line-height
- Reduced table margins from 1em to 0.7em

**Result:** 
- More condensed, professional appearance
- Less scrolling required to view entire CV
- Information is more readily accessible at a glance
- PDF output is now 5 pages
